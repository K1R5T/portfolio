                <h3>Where it all began</h3>

                <p>
                    I started with CodeNation in November 2019, the first course I attended was the Develop Cyber 3 week course.
                    During my time on the cyber course I learnt some interesting things, from the different types of hackers to
                    how to pick a lock. There was a lot of variety on the course and the tutor was great, I met some interesting
                    people and enjoyed my time on the course.

                <h3>Realisation</h3>
                
                <p>
                    One thing I realised when I was on the cyber course is that it was not actually for me, but how did I come
                    to this conclusion. Well during my time in the Manchester CodeNation HQ I was sitting in the communal area
                    eating my lunch, that is when I noticed the big screen and all this pretty looking code, it made me curious,
                    I had to know what is was about so I decided to speak to a member of staff who told me it was code that the
                    Master Coding class was doing, so I asked how I can get on the coding course and they told me about the 3
                    week Develop Coding course they had starting in January after the Christmas break, so I signed up for it nad
                    I am glad I did.

                        <h3>Develop Coding Week 1 Day 1</h3>
                <p>
                    When I started the Develop Coading course on the 7th of January, I just knew that this is what I wanted, now
                    I needed to find a way of taking this short course and making something biogger out of it. On day 4 of the
                    course there was a job advertised on the slack channel and decided I would give it a shot, even though I
                    knew I didn't have the skills or experience to do the job I had nothing to lose, so I went for it.

                <p>
                    Day 5 9am and my phone starts ringing, it's one of the engagement team, she told me that the job I had put
                    my name for was a bit to far away but would I be interedted in another position, I didn't know what to say
                    so I just said yes and went for it. I didn't know what to expect or anything.

                    <h3>Week 2</h3>
                <p>
                    Monday week 2 I had to leave the course at lunch time because it was being held at Trafford College in
                    Timperley and I needed to be at CodeNation in Manchester City Centre for an Interview Prep, this was to help
                    me when I got to the recruitment session which was suposed to be on the Wednesday, but when I arrived at
                    CodeNation on Monday I was asked if I wanted to attend a secon recruitment day, obviously I said yes why
                    wouldn't I, the more opportunities the better. The first 2 recruitment sessions I attended I left feeling
                    very proud, I may not have been offered and interview or a job but I gained some good experience and got
                    some positive feedback from the recruiters.

                    <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <p> 
                    Jump to week 3 now and I had one more recruitment session to attend before the course finished, but it
                    turned out I didn't get that one either, I was feeling a little sad but not dissapointed and still very
                    enthusiastic as I knew I would be inivted to more in the future, there was still a chance and I knew I had
                    to keep going, except before I left that 3rd and what I thought was the final recruitment session I would
                    attend for a while I was approached by another member of the engagement team asking me if I wanted to attend
                    another one the following day, now I was all excited again.
                    <br></br>
                    I went home and researched the company and was really interested to know more bout them. The next morning I
                    got up and went to CodeNation Manchester to meet the CEO and Director of this company. Little did I know
                    these guys were about to become my new employers.

                    <h3>So heres how it went</h3>
                <p>
                    I walked in as I do, I got my self a seat and waited patiently for the recruiters to arrive. When they
                    arrived they were very friendly said good morning to us all and sat down on th chairs they were provided
                    with to sit on in front of the group of people hoping to bag them selves a job (like all sessions haha).
                    From the moment they sat down there was a lot of eye contact, I had a good feeling about this one, I just
                    knew it was for me so I had to give it my all. The session got started the guys started telling us about
                    their company, about them and how it all started, now I was even more interested.
                    <br></br>
                    Here come the stand ups, the part thst makes me nervous and probably many others that have ever done this
                    type of thing, I had to stand up in front of the recruiters and the other students wanting this position and
                    talk about my self for 2 minutes, now that doesn't seem long right? wrong it feels like a long long time and
                    you have a million and one things going through your head, am I good enough, am I rambling, are they even
                    listening, but guess what I did none of that what I was thinking and they maintained eye contact and really
                    listened to what I was saying, now I had a really good feeling. Next come the group challenge, we had to
                    create an app that would link with another device/system and give back some diagnostics, data et... I didn't
                    feel like I did particularly well on this part but I was so wrong.

                    <h3>I got an Interview</h3>

                <p>
                    I was invited to an interview the next day at the recruiters premises, I was so happy I didn't stop smiling
                    for the rest of the day. The next day which was Friday 24th January I travelled to the employers premises
                    and had my interview (and lunch they were very kind and welcoming), after I had my interview I went home and
                    waited for the all important email, did I get the job or didn't I, only time would tell. 4:30pm and I
                    received an email big letter CONGRATULATIONS, I did it I got the job, I was so happy it felt like it was the
                    best day of my life.
                    <br></br>
                    I had the weekend off and started Monday 27th January on the Master Coding Course, this was the first day of
                    the rest of my life, my new career, my dreams had come true I was now in my dream career and it can only get
                    better from here.
