                        I am currently on a Master Coding Course with Code Nation, getting on this course was like a dream come
                        true, but what made it even better is that I got it on an apprentiship.
                        <br></br>
                        Since I was young I have had an interest in technology and computers, but didn't what it was that I wanted
                        to know at the time.
                        <br></br>
                        As I got older and started working, I did lots of jobs but none of them was my dream job. I worked in a take
                        away, in a factory, in a warehouse and eventually moved on to be a security guard, but even then I was not
                        happy, so I tried to be a support worker but I was told I care to much by management so I decided to give up
                        and go back to security.

                    <p className="security">
                        During my time as a Security guard I decided I was going to look at pursuing my dreams and started to look
                        what courses were available for me to do in my own time around work, that's when I came across a course with
                        free to learn. It was a web design and development course, but I soon discovered that the course content was
                        not what I was looking for and wanted something more in depth and techy.
                        <br></br>
                        This is when I started to look at other options but was struggling to find something that suited what I
                        wanted. I ended up having a chat with my brother who pointed me in the direction of Code Nation, I ended up
                        on their website looking at what they had to offer and downloaded a brochure, but life got in the way and I
                        left it at that and carried on working to pay the bills.

                    <p className="dayoff">
                        One day after a week of long shifts I finally had a day off, I was just relaxing when my phone started to
                        ring and it was one of the lovely guys from Code Nation, they told me all about the course they had to offer
                        and the different options that were open to me.
                        <br></br>
                        I ended up going into the Manchester Code Nation office and decided to do the Develop Cyber course, I
                        thought that is what I wanted, but during the time of the course and my time in the building I was watching
                        other students do the Coding course and that is when I knew that is what I wanted to do I wanted to work
                        with code. I ended up having a chat with a member of staff who helped me to sign up for the next Develop
                        Coding course they had.

                    <p className="quickBrief">
                        During my first week on the 3 week Develop Coding course, there was an apprentiship advertised on slack. At
                        that time I didn't know if I was ready for that but I decided to throw my self in at the deep end and go for
                        it any way.
                        <br></br>
                        The day after I put my name forward I received a call from one of the engagement team, telling me that the
                        job I put my name forward for was too far to travel but there were other opportunities available, so I put
                        my name forward and this is where my tech journey really started.
                        <br></br>
                        I went to 3 recruitment sessions between week 2 and week 3 of the Develop Course, which ment I was missing
                        out on learning with my group, but that was ok because getting an apprentiship was more important to me
                        because I knew the master course would teach me far more than the develop course could. My 4th and last
                        recruitment session was where my career began, I was offered a job my dreams started to become reality and
                        it felt amazing.
